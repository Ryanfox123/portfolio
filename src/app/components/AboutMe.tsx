              Hey, I‚Äôm a{" "}
              <span className="font-semibold">Software Developer</span> who
              loves learning new things and building cool projects. Here‚Äôs a bit
              about how I got here.
            </p>

            <p>
              I first got into coding as a hobby while I was working as an
              <span className="font-semibold"> air-conditioning engineer</span>.
              In the evenings I‚Äôd mess around with free online courses and
              YouTube tutorials, slowly getting the hang of{" "}
              <span className="italic">JavaScript, HTML, CSS</span>, and
              eventually
              <span className="italic"> Express</span> and{" "}
              <span className="italic">React</span>. My first little apps were a
              URL shortener and a note maker ‚Äî nothing fancy, but they lit the
              spark for me.
            </p>

            <p>
              After a while, I knew I wanted to take it further, so I left my
              old job and joined the{" "}
              <span className="font-semibold">
                Northcoders Fullstack Bootcamp
              </span>
              . That‚Äôs where I really started to level up ‚Äî learning things like
              pair programming, AGILE, and test-driven development. I also met a
              bunch of brilliant people who made the whole experience even
              better.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now I‚Äôm focused on landing my first developer role. While I apply
              for jobs, I‚Äôm keeping my skills sharp by building personal
              projects (you can find some here or on my GitHub). I‚Äôm excited to
              keep improving and see where this path takes me.
            </p>
